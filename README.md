# ðŸ“Œ 1. Objective
The goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive sales analysis using SQL queries to derive business insights from a company's sales database. This includes examining shipping modes, customer behavior, sales performance, product profitability, regional statistics, and overall revenue trends.

# ðŸ›  2. Tools Used
- SQL Workbench â€“ for running and managing SQL queries

- SQL (Structured Query Language) â€“ for data retrieval and manipulation

- Relational Database (MySQL) â€“ containing a sales table with structured transaction data

# ðŸ”„ 3. Steps Included
- Database Initialization: Created and used the company database and accessed the sales table.

- Data Exploration: Queried the full dataset and performed row count checks.

- Business-Oriented Queries:

  - Filtered sales by shipping mode and sales threshold

  - Isolated category-specific sales by country and date

  - Identified most profitable transactions

  - Searched by customer and product name patterns

  - Aggregated sales by city

  - Retrieved revenue stats and ranked products by sales

- Advanced SQL Features:

  - Used LIKE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, RANK(), LIMIT, and window functions

# ðŸ“Š 4. Analysis Included
- Sales trends by shipping mode and amount

- Country- and category-specific transactions

- Profitability rankings of individual sales

- Pattern-based customer and product name filtering
